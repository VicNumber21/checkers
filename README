Checkers (draughts) game.

Personal research project to learn how to make efficient algorithms for games.

The rules of the game are simplified for faster startup of development:
1. Bord is 8x8.
2. 12 checkers for each player.
3. King can go one square only.

The plan is to support two modes:
1. Traditional game.
2. Givaway game.

It might be that in future I will add support of:
1. 10x10 board.
2. King move is limited by board size only (Russian version of the game).
